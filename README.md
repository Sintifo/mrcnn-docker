# Dockerized Training of Mask_RCNN

This image builds on the fantastic [Deepo](https://github.com/ufoym/deepo) project to build a easy to use docker image for Mask_RCNN.
The image is configured at the moment for Cuda 9.0, Tensorflow 1 and Python 3.6, due to the TF2 support of Mask_RCNN not being ready yet.

When the Mask_RCNN support of TF2 and the inbuilt Keras is ready, I am going to upgrade this image.
